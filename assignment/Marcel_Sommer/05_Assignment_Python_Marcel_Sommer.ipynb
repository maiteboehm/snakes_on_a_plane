    "## Task 01 – Text Pre-Processing\n",
    "A computational analysis of natural language text typically requires several pre-processing steps, such as excluding irrelevant text parts, separating the text into words, phrases, or sentences depending on the analysis use case, removing so-called stop words, i.e., words that contain little to no semantic meaning, and normalizing the texts, e.g., by removing punctuation and capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the *download_file()* function developed in the past assignments to download the plain text versions of Shakespeare’s play [Macbeth](https://ia802707.us.archive.org/1/items/macbeth02264gut/0ws3410.txt) and Bacon’s [New Atlantis](https://ia801309.us.archive.org/24/items/newatlantis02434gut/nwatl10.txt). If you choose not to implement assignment 4, task 6, download the files manually. We will also provide some txt files.\n",

    "the texts for computational analysis. Implement the following functions to perform common pre-processing steps on the texts:\n",

    "    - Information about the file, acknowledgements, copyright notices etc.\n",
    "    - Headings indicating the act and scene\n",
    "    - Stage instructions\n",
    "    - Character names\n",
    "2. *normalize_text()*\n",
    "    - converts all text to lower case\n",
    "    - removes all punctuation from the texts\n",
    "3. *remove_stopwords()* – eliminates all stop words that are part of the list of English stop words (we provide two lists of stopwords, try both and see how they perform)\n",
    "4. *tokenize_text()* – splits the cleaned text into words\n",

    "The [Baconian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baconian_theory_of_Shakespeare_authorship) holds that Sir Francis Bacon is the author of Shakespeare’s plays. We want to perform a very simple stylistic analysis between Shakespeare’s play Macbeth and Bacon’s New Atlantis.
